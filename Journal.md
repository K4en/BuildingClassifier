## Project Journal – Learning From Learning

This project started with a simple idea: build a model that can tell what kind of building it's looking at. But instead of relying on pre-trained networks or copying an existing approach, I wanted to see if I could create something from scratch — something that reflects how I think.

Along the way, I began to ask questions not about the data or the code, but about learning itself.

Why do we forget some things and hold on to others?
How do we decide what lessons matter?
What if a machine could do the same?

That's where the idea of a **replay buffer** came in — a way for the model to remember its most impactful examples from each training run. Not all the data. Just the moments that mattered. The ones that were either:
- extremely confident (proof it “got it right”)
- extremely wrong (proof it still had something to learn)

These are stored and replayed in future training sessions — like memory flashbacks. It's not about preventing forgetting. It's about remembering **with purpose**.

I didn’t write the implementation code from scratch. I used ChatGPT to help me shape and scaffold it. But the thinking, the structure, and the design — that’s mine.

It might be chaotic. It might not be formal. But it's real. And that's worth documenting.

## 🔜 Next Phases
- [ ] Extend to multiclass (e.g. religious, commercial, ancient, etc.)
- [ ] Visualize predictions on single images
- [ ] Transition to cultural and stylistic classification (e.g. Gothic, Baroque)

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Multiclass Cultural Classification

### ✅ Training Overview
- **Model:** Custom CNN (`BuildingClassifier` with replay buffer)
- **Classes:** Chinese, Egyptian, European, Greek, Indian
- **Dataset:** ~880 images across 5 classes (post-split validation set)
- **Epochs:** 5
- **Replay Buffer:** Enabled – 10 best + 10 worst samples per epoch

### 📉 Training Loss (5 Epochs)
- Epoch 1: Loss = 1.4967
- Epoch 2: Loss = 1.2377
- Epoch 3: Loss = 1.0624
- Epoch 4: Loss = 0.9311
- Epoch 5: Loss = 0.7879

### 🧪 Evaluation Results
- **Overall Accuracy:** 78.64%

#### 📊 Per-Class Performance
| Class     | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Chinese   | 0.94      | 0.78   | 0.85     |
| Egyptian  | 0.74      | 0.86   | 0.80     |
| European  | 0.70      | 0.77   | 0.73     |
| Greek     | 0.91      | 0.83   | 0.87     |
| Indian    | 0.70      | 0.69   | 0.70     |

### 🔍 Observations
- Model performs strongest on **Greek** and **Chinese** classes
- **Indian** class had lowest F1 — may benefit from more data or contrastive samples
- Replay buffer likely helped maintain stable improvements each epoch

---

### 🔄 Next Steps
- Increase epoch count to 10–15
- Explore data augmentation (lighting, perspective)
- Begin Phase 3: Style classification (Baroque, Gothic, etc.)

## Appendix: The Original Thought That Sparked the Replay Buffer

I’m keeping this here because it’s how the idea first came to me. It wasn’t academic or clean. It was just me thinking aloud:

> *“Well yeah. I mean I'm not a programming engineer, but I guess it should be possible to save some kind of reference point after each training along with something like I don't know... 10-20 datapoints that gave the most accuracy during training or helped the most or smth and when later updating the training use it as a sort of ‘yeah this IS old data, but it is a chair or house as well just as accurate than the new data’.  
>  
> Or save the best and worst and add it again to the new training dataset.  
>  
> I mean that's sort of how humans work too. Take what's working, keep updating, but sometimes despite all your new insights and evolved methods you still can't solve the problem and that's when you think back to the beginning of your journey and go like ‘waaaait a minute... I used to be able to solve this thing this way too, I know it's very archaic, but let's try it’ and boom, solved.”*

This wasn’t written for anyone but me, but I’m keeping it here to show that original ideas don’t always come in clean lines. Sometimes they come in half-sentences and “or smth” — and that’s okay.

This is where the replay buffer idea came from. This was the seed.

## Next Steps: Evolution of Classification

This project will move beyond binary classification and into multi-class cultural and stylistic detection.

I plan to expand it in two phases:

### 1. Cultural Classification
Identify architectural origin from full images:
- Egyptian
- Greek
- Roman
- Chinese
- Islamic
- Medieval European
- Modern Western

### 2. Style Recognition Within Cultures
Drill down into styles like:
- Renaissance, Baroque, Gothic, Brutalist
- Ming vs Tang (Chinese)
- Persian vs Moorish (Islamic)

This mirrors how architectural history is taught: understand the **culture**, then the **evolution of its expression**.

And that’s the direction I’m building toward — a model that doesn’t just see *what a building is*, but understands *where it comes from* and *why it looks the way it does*.

🔁 Phase 4: Self-Improving Replay Mechanism
✅ Goals

Introduce continual learning by using high-confidence predictions as self-reinforcement

Extract:

Focus Pool: most confident correct predictions

Reinforce Pool: incorrect predictions at high confidence (when available)

Replay these samples in future training to strengthen or correct learned patterns

🧠 Key Mechanism

During validation, the model logs confidence + correctness for every sample

After each run, a separate script:

Saves the top-N confident correct predictions as focus.json

Saves high-confidence wrong predictions as reinforce.json

Future training re-injects these via lightweight loaders to guide the model

🏋️‍♂️ Replay Training Details

Focus Pool Size: 83 samples

Reinforce Pool: Not used (0 samples available in current run)

Fine-tuning Epochs: 3 (on focus samples)

📈 Replay Fine-Tune Results

Training accuracy continued improving on the refined subset

Model successfully re-aligned internal representations by re-seeing what it knew

Demonstrates potential for self-guided improvement without human labels
