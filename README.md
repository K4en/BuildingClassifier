## ðŸ§  Conceptual Design: Human-Inspired Learning

This project explores a custom CNN trained to classify building types from scratch â€” no pre-trained models used.

What makes it unique is the integration of **human-inspired continual learning**:

- The model doesn't just learn from new data.
- It **remembers its most meaningful past experiences** (best & worst samples).
- Each training round is enhanced with a **replay buffer** â€” like a memory.
- Inspired by how humans revisit important lessons when facing new problems.

I designed this approach based on my own understanding of how we learn: not by keeping everything, but by remembering what matters.

This system simulates a small form of long-term memory and evolving intelligence.
