# 🏗️ AI Building Classifier

This project is a from-scratch convolutional neural network built using PyTorch to classify architectural images. The model begins with simple binary classification (e.g., **residential** vs **industrial**) and is evolving toward a full **multi-class architecture recognition system**, including both **cultural origins** (e.g., Egyptian, Chinese, Greek) and **stylistic classifications** (e.g., Renaissance, Baroque).

What makes this project different is that it mirrors **how humans learn** — through *meaningful memory*. The model saves the most significant examples from each training run (best and worst) and reuses them during future training to simulate a kind of **learning memory**. This concept is known in machine learning as *replay buffering* or *exemplar memory*, but it was developed here from a natural human insight.

- [x] Resume training with memory-injected batches
- [x] Binary classifier (residential vs industrial)
- [x] Multi-class cultural classifier (Chinese, Egyptian, European, Greek, Indian)

## 🧠 Conceptual Design

Rather than just train on more and more data, this model is designed to **remember what mattered**. Each epoch, it saves the 10 most confidently correct and 10 most confusing samples. These are injected into future training runs, ensuring that the model is learning **not just more, but better**.

This concept is based on how humans often return to defining moments in our learning journeys — both successes and failures — to anchor deeper understanding.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 — Binary Classification
- Residential vs Industrial buildings using scraped data

### ✅ Phase 2 — Multi-Class Cultural Classification
- Categories like: Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, Indian, European
- Replay buffer extended to multi-class scenario
- Achieved ~79% accuracy on validation

### 🔜 Phase 3 — Fine-Grained Architectural Style Classification
- Classify architectural **styles** within cultural categories
- Examples: Renaissance, Baroque, Gothic, Brutalist, Neoclassical

### 🔮 Phase 4 — Self-Improving Memory Loop
- Use replay memory to auto-refine misclassifications
- Incorporate knowledge-based reasoning and image similarity
- Move closer to human-like adaptive learning

## 📊 Multi-Class Validation Results (Phase 2)

| Class     | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Chinese   | 0.94      | 0.78   | 0.85     |
| Egyptian  | 0.74      | 0.86   | 0.80     |
| European  | 0.70      | 0.77   | 0.73     |
| Greek     | 0.91      | 0.83   | 0.87     |
| Indian    | 0.70      | 0.69   | 0.70     |
| **Avg**   | **0.80**  | **0.79** | **0.79** |

## ♻️ Phase 4 — Replay-Based Self-Improvement

The model now incorporates a **replay refinement loop**, where it:
- Logs predictions on the validation set during training.
- Extracts high-confidence correct (`focus`) and high-confidence incorrect (`reinforce`) samples.
- Re-injects these samples during future training to focus on meaningful mistakes and strengths.

This mimics how humans review both best and worst examples to deepen understanding.
