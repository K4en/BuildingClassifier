## 🧠 Purpose

This project is more than just an architectural classifier.  
It’s a prototype for a new kind of AI system — one that helps people **learn**, **grow**, and **elevate** rather than automate away their roles.

This tool is designed not to replace professionals, but to **accelerate learning**, especially for junior talent.  
It trains the eye, builds intuition, and preserves the value of human judgment in a world drifting toward full automation.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

### 1. **Augment, Don’t Replace**
AI should amplify human skill — not make it obsolete.  
This tool helps architects, students, and creators develop faster recognition of architectural patterns and cultural styles — *while they grow their expertise*, not in place of it.

### 2. **Learning is Built In**
The classifier includes a **training mode** where users guess styles before seeing the answer.  
This gamified feedback loop helps reinforce knowledge and confidence over time.  
It's not just a tool — it's a teacher.

### 3. **Fair Profit, Collective Gain**
This project may be paid initially to fund its development, but it is built with a **sunset clause**:  
Once a fair milestone is met (e.g. $5,000 in funding or June 30, 2027), the full system becomes open-source.

Early supporters don’t just buy access — they help unlock it for others, including their future competitors.

### 4. **No Exploitation**
Buyers may use and modify the tool privately, but **no permanent reselling or redistribution** is allowed.  
Derived works must follow a similar release ethic: they cannot become locked away forever behind permanent paywalls.

We support innovation — but not hoarding.

### 5. **Sustainable Systems Thinking**
Replacing the workforce with AI may look efficient now — but it starves the economy long-term.  
This tool follows a **regenerative philosophy**:
- Grow smarter humans
- Elevate their capacity
- Sustain demand across the ecosystem

If juniors are replaced instead of trained, the industry loses future experts — and eventually, even customers.

## ⚙️ Practical Implementation

- Project begins under the **Business Source License (BSL 1.1)** or equivalent.
- Code becomes open-source after:
  - A $5,000 revenue milestone, **or**
  - A hard release date (e.g. June 30, 2027)
- Core features are built for educational and ethical use, with feedback and transparency at the center

## 💬 Final Words

This isn’t just code — it’s a **blueprint** for a better model of growth.  
One that says:
> “We don’t need to outrun humans — we need to **upgrade them**.”

This project won’t replace you.  
It’ll help you see more clearly, learn more deeply, and build with confidence.

Because when one rises — everyone can.
